# hamsheets

Being a noob to amateur radio, I've been hunting around for various practice sheets to help solidify my knowledge.

However, as a visual learner I found that a bit of a challenge. Reams of text just goes in one eyball and out... somewhere...
Listening to someone just lecturing doesn't work for my brain, either -- I need to visualize how things work and let my brain chew on it for a bit.

And the best way I've found is to practice specific items over and over until those connections are made.

In this branch, you'll find various practice sheets I've created. There's a mixture of visual and visual with text, and the majority of them will have practice questions included.

I hope you find them useful.

NOTE: These practice are based on the Canadian Amateur Radio - Basic Qualification question pool as of 2020.
